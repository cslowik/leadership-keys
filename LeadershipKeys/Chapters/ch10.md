# White Space Issues

The word _intelligence_ comes from a Latin derivation, meaning “entering through the lines.” As a leader, people are always reading into what you are saying or not saying. They fill in the white space between the lines in moments. The bold lines indicate what was said.

## `- - - - - - - -` 
Negative signs indicate what gets filled in quickly by others, because they are intelligent. It is usually inaccurate, judgmental and not giving you or the leader the benefit of the doubt. It is done to have more of a sense of control.

## `+ + + + + + + +`
Positive signs indicate what you say when you fill in the white space proactively with accurate and positive data, talking about opportunities.

* “White space is going to get filled any way by others; you can be preventative by telling your people what you know.”
* “If you are not sick and tired of saying the same thing over and over again, you are not saying it enough.”
* “If you don’t tell your people what is going on, they will think nothing is going on.”
