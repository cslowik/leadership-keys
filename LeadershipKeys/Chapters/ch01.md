# Leadership Two-Step

Leadership has a rhythm and beat to it. You have to know the right time to step in and when to step out. Star leaders feel the beat and make the appropriate steps. They don’t take their direct reports problems or “monkeys”, but help them deal with their “monkeys” with support and resources. Rank yourself on each of the steps, on a 1-10\. Practice the steps which will help you the most to become good at all the steps.

## 1 Step In

Set the vision, systems and structure, clarify expectations, identify the deliverables and timetable, establish resources available, encourage and motivate.

### Step In - If it’s going well

Support and acknowledge, spread the news, codify what is working well to replicate. Hold the accountability. Monitor, evaluate and adjust. Reiterate the vision and deliverables.

### Step In - If it’s not going well

"Right the ship". Understand what is the issue and what they have tried. Make a decision quickly after you have checked in with them. Reiterate the vision and deliverables. Clarify expectations and resources.

## 2 Step Out

Leave alone and let them come to you if they have questions, Empower and encourage them to use their own best judgment. Redirect to others. Manage resources. Fight the urge to step in and take over. Recognize and support. Don't take their problems or “monkeys.”

#### Repeat steps as needed
