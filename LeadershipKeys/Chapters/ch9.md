# Managing Up & Partnering
When dealing with your supervisor or key customer, stakeholder or partner, it is important to understand their preferences and needs. This will help you align your performance to be viewed as a star by them. Below are questions and conversations to assist you.

## Responsibility alignment
What do they see as your top 5 responsibilities of your position? What do you see as your top 5 responsibilities of your position? Typically only 1.5 of the five are the same, therefore you may be working on the wrong priorities. This conversation will help you work on the areas that will get you the furthest in your supervisors’ or partners’ eyes.

## Expectations clarification
What are your supervisors or partners key expectations of you? Ask them: for this relationship to be a success,what are the key things I need to do and don’t do? Make sure you talk about responsiveness on email and voice mail.

##Information Gathering
Do they like a formal approach or informal? Should you come with reports, data, agenda and be highly organized? Or be more informal and talk about the big picture possibilities and opportunities? Mirror their language; are they visual (“see, view”) or auditory (“sounds like, talk, resonate”) or kinesthetic (“get a hold of, action”)?

##Decision style
How does your supervisor or partner make decisions? Quickly with limited data? Or deliberate with a lot of information? Do they like to discuss all the possibilities? Or should you leave the office and let them reflect on it and get back with them in a day? If you are not sure, ask them.

##Conflict style
Do they thrive in conflict or avoid it? Do you feel each conversation is part of a debating club? Or do they strive for harmony and peace at all costs? If you are not sure, ask them.

Research has shown that if you feel not listened to and unfairly criticized by your boss consistently over time your chance of a heart attack goes up 30%.” _Goleman, 2006_
